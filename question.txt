 Honest opinion. With what we have i want to make very definitive changes.
  1. Firebase as database and not supabse; and it must work the same way without issues. Following the schema
  2. Same code for frontend. I want the frontend hosted on vercel and backend on render. We can use firebase for auth or any simpler secure free alternative

  Compared to what we have right now? Is this possible and it will work right?

  Because right now, the issues I'm having with this particular one is database issues. It can't support users running concurrently.
  I still want the frontend to look the same though. I don't want to break my code. WHat do you have in mind?
